## Development process

### Development tools

- Vite - development build and workflow tool
- Neovim - code editor leveraging lazyvim config
- Terminal (iTerm2 supports fonts and colors required for a good user experience)
- Tmux - Terminal multiplexer for session management and
  supporting multiple terminal instances

All the above tools allow for an efficient and ergonomic coding
experience that allows me to leverage my experience working
within a shell environment.

### Tech stack

- Vite
- Vanilla JS
- SCSS

The above technologies were selected because SCSS requires preprocessing
and Vite provides an easy low friction method to bootstrapping
a web front end project that requires some level of
build automation (such as transpiling and outputting SCSS to CSS).
The same base tool set can be extended for more advanced use cases
and development workflows as may be required in future -
such as automated testing, bundling etc.

### Coding standards

- BEM CSS

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - helped clarify how to implement the BEM standard.
- [Fluid Typography](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) -
  calculate clamp function values.
