## Development process

### Development tools

- Git - Version control
- Vite - development build and workflow tool

### Tech stack

- Vite
- Vanilla JS
- SCSS

The above technologies were selected because SCSS requires preprocessing
and Vite provides an easy low friction method to bootstrapping
a web front end project that requires some level of
build automation (such as transpiling and outputting SCSS to CSS).
The same base tool set can be extended for more advanced use cases
and development workflows as may be required in future -
such as automated testing, bundling etc.
